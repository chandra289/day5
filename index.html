        <p>Artificial intelligence is the ability of a computer or computer-controlled 
            robot to perform tasks that are commonly associated with the intellectual processes 
            characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason.</p>

       <h2>key components of AI</h2>
       <p>Artificial Intelligence is a broad field that has multiple components working
         together to comprehend the input. AI encompasses many technologies and
         subfields. Let us now look at the key components of AI:</p>

        <p>Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that gives systems the
             ability to learn and optimize processes without having to be consistently programmed. 
             Simply put, machine learning uses data, statistics and trial 
            and error to “learn” a specific task without ever having to be specifically coded for the task.</p>

        <h2>what is DL?</h2>
        <img src="../images/4.jpg" height="250px" width="250px">
        <p>Deep learning is just a type of machine learning, inspired by the structure of the human brain. 
            Deep learning algorithms attempt to draw similar conclusions as humans would by continually analyzing 
            data with a given logical structure. 
            To achieve this, deep learning uses multi-layered structures of algorithms called neural networks.</p>
